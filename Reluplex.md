- Introduction
	- Programming by machine learning
	- overview on software written by ML
	- Introduce Problem: Verifying ML-Software
- Introduce an example of ML written software (Drone collision detection / Autonomos vehicles)
- Briefly explain how these Software work:
	- Functionality of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) 
		- Efficiency problems
		- Reluplex reducing efficiency load (example)
- DNNs:
	- brief explanation of DNNs
		- using example
	- what is verifying a Software
		- generalization
		- explain in example
- Main Problem: activation Functions:
	- Rectified Linear Units
		- explain
		- Function for the Algorithm
		- NP-Complete
- Linear Programms
	- Case Splitting
	- Worst-Case Efficiency (too low = not practical)
		- Show in example
- Reducing load with Reluplex:
