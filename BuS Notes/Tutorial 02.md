### Question 1:

**a)** What are the tasks of memory management in operating systems? 

**b)** What tasks does the MMU perform? What is the purpose of dividing a virtual address into segment number (or page number) and offset?  
**c)** Is it possible that a virtual address is called for which no physical address exists? If so, how should the MMU handle it? 

**d)** Why is it beneficial to implement the MMU as a hardware component rather than performing the necessary calculations in software?
