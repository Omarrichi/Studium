## Bonus: Segmentation vs. Paging

Note: 1 GiB = $2^{30} bytes, 1 MiB =2^{20}bytes$

*Option 1: Paging with pages of 4 bytes in size*
1.1 How many entries would there be in the page table?

1.2 Why such a small page size could cause a lot of TLB misses.

1.3 What is the size of the page table for the single translation, with 1 level of page table?

1.4 What about 2 levels of page table?

1.5 What about 7 levels of page table?

1.6 Why is this number of levels problematic?
